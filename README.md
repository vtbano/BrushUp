# BrushUp

Create quizzes with the BrushUp app! This app was designed to help you create quick quizzes to help you study or review some material you think you need to BrushUp on. The multiple choice design was created with flexibility in mind, meaning you can add as many correct or wrong answers as you like. You just need to ensure that the question you ask is descriptive and gives you and your quiz taker a good understanding of how many possible correct answers there are to choose from. You also have the capability to add images along with your questions.

Supporting and sharing is important to me, so I've designed BrushUp to allow sharing capabilities. The user is able to share the quiz with their friends, and even they can continue passing on a link to share with their contacts as-well. The effort you put to creating a quiz won't go wasted, and the knowledge you gain with creating the quiz will be shared to those taking it too!

You may be interested in tracking who completed the quiz out of the people you've shared it with. We have that tracking covered in BrushUp.Once a quiz taker completes a quiz and gets their final score, the completion will be logged into the data base. Once a quiz taker completes a quiz, it will only log into the database once.

Brush up in your knowledge and skills with friends!

## Brush Up User flow

  Once you've navigated to BrushUp landing page you have the option of Getting Started and creating an account or going directly to the Login Page.

You can easily _Delete_ your questions or _Edit_ the questions and the answer options.

- **Add answer options to specific questions**

After you click Add Question you will be directed to a page where you can type the question, add a image using an image url address, and add correct and wrong answers. You can add as many correct and wrong answers you would like.

**_Tip:_** Make sure you identify how many correct answers there are for that question within the body of your question. When the quiz taker is going through answering the questions, it won't go to the next question until they've selected the amount of possible correct answers there are. So if there are 3 correct answers and there are 5 options, the quiz taker must select at least 3 answer options.

- **Invite people to take the quiz**

Once you click the **Share symbol** this will redirect you to a view where you can create unique URL links for each person you want to share the quiz with. Each person you add will be added as a respondent. You can then be able to track out of the people you decided to directly share the quiz with, who finished the quiz, regardless if it is a pass or a fail.

- **Track quiz completion**

How can you view the track quiz completion? Click the **pie chart**, a button that is located in the top navigation bar.

It will show you the quizzes you've created, how many people you've shared the quiz with and how many people completed the quiz you've shared.
